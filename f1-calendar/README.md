This app is a non-profit personal project.

As a Formula 1 fan, I created my own calendar to apply the knowledge acquired from the Android Basics with Compose course (Unit 3).

The APK is available to download here: MyF1Calendar\app\build\outputs\apk

Resources:
- Every track SVG was designed by me, using Inkscape, as well as the background grid.
- The F1 logo is from https://www.formula1.com/ .
- The flags were sourced from Wikimedia Commons: https://commons.wikimedia.org/ .
